The trials of entrepreneurship!

Today I'll address receiving large shipments from China. Refer back to this experience in the future; remember there once was a day when you had to earn your food by the sweat of your brow and brawn.

So, earlier today thousands of units arrived from China - hundreds of master-packed boxes of product. I had been waiting for weeks. The issues was that I assumed I would have unlimited time to unload the truck.

Nope!

The driver told me I have 15 minutes to off-load the 40 foot truck before he is going to leave - with my product if needed! 

So I did what any sensible entrepreneur would do in the situation; I hired dudes off the street to help move them into storage! Talk about hustle. These guys impressed me! They were working to feed their kids. And I realized *TRULY* how good a thing it is to have the means to pay another man for his labor. I realized that I was satisfied for having completed the task at hand. But I was more satisfied that I was able to pay these guys for honest work.Â I paid them well for a job very well done.

That said, I hope NEVER to have to repeat this experience. Totally stressful!
