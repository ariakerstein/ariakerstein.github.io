I did a powerlifting class yesterday. I'm built like a runner - definitely not going to win any competitions snatching weights overhead. But the more powerful part of the sport for me is actually the moment *before* the lift. For me at least there is a tremendous focus of energy (visual, neuro-muscular, processing doubt and overcoming it) into visualizing the lift I'm about to complete; improper execution would hurt! I used to do this visualization before competitions but it's been a while. I'll continue if only for that moment of sublime focus in hopes of re-patterning this circuit for other aspects of my lift. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2305" src="http://www.samuelakerstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/snatch.jpg" alt="snatch" width="650" height="325" />
