Ever feel like you're toiling but there's not much work getting done. Do you ever feel that project you've been trying to finish for the last 2 weeks is the living embodiment of <a href="http://mathforum.org/isaac/problems/zeno1.html">Zeno's paradox</a>? Can you relate?<!--more-->

I've found that in addressing this very real workplace issue the best approach is to do 3 things:
<ul>
 	<li>Anticipate/plan for the situation</li>
 	<li>Lower the pressure</li>
 	<li>Execute against timers</li>
</ul>

<b>Anticipate &amp; Plan. </b>Recognize and name it for what it is ahead of time. Having tracked this myself for some time it is clear this slump happens in a daily and weekly cadence. For example I know that generally Mondays will not be my productive, <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">deep work</a> day. I also know that between noon and 2 or 3 on most days I'm firing fewer cortical brain cells. As such I try to front load my week with meetings, alignments and lighter types of interactions with my team. I block off my mornings and mid/late afternoons most other days for deep work. I've found that it's critical to understand my patterns and work around them versus engineering my circadian rhythms to fit a 9-5 schedule. Here's roughly what my personal energy looks like after tracking it for several months. I've found it enormously important to map my quality thinking/productivity time against the white and green days/times where possible in this table. I guard against operating on deep work in the red zones as they tend to result in frustration.

<b>Lower the pressure and clear my head. </b>I maintain high expectations of myself. I've found it helpful to work with my rhythms, and not to fight them. An analogy that helps is revving a cold car first thing in the morning - avoid doing that to the engine. Better to plan ahead and take the time to wait 5 minutes idling. Go slow to go fast. This translates at work to permission to take an extra coffee break or walk to clear the hear.  Accelerate the rest of the week.

<strong>Execute against Timers. </strong>I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730">Pomodoro method</a> to stay focused on a single task. Distractions are a major obstacle to getting things done. Productivity tools with few exceptions move folks in a direction orthogonal to being more effective. Let's not confuse manic activity for effectiveness. I'm working on an app now to optimize this flow.

Do you have any tips that work for you? Have you noticed certain days and times are better than others?
