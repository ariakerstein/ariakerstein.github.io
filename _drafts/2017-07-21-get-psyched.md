I've been doing a lot of basic, heavy weight lifting first thing in the morning over the past few months. My quarterly goal is to deadlift 2x my bodyweight. The reason is to test my hypothesis that it'll improve my running. If you think about running it's about stride rate x frequency, or bigger, faster steps. I really like the analogy of running legs comprising a wheel (close your eyes and visualize looking at the shoes of a runner from the side - what pattern does it trace? Take a moment, can you see it?). The bigger the wheel the faster you'll go - all else equal:).

Anyway, the point of this post is to take a moment to discuss getting psyched. Doing heavy deadlifts at 6am is not easy, especially when pushing the limits of one's body. What I've been finding most interesting is the quality of the moment before the lift. You're pushing beyond barriers, facing failure - literally and physically. How do you think about that when you're wrapping your hands around the bar?

I've found a few helpful tricks for this.

<strong>Neutralize negative self talk. </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>I've got 2 modes of operation - high confidence vs. deflation. Deflation usually is accompanied by comparison's to people I know that I think are 10x better than I am OR memory of a failure. Say I tried lifting 100 lbs last week and failed - and today I'm doing 100 again. There can be a mental sticking point there to get past your history. I've found that creating a greatest mental hits "priming" playlist helps with confidence in case I'm down on myself. For example replaying a time I got past a sticking point in the past that resonates with the problem at hand.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Be ok with failing. A lot. </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>You need to seek failure and constantly be stress testing yourself. Improvement is about effective cycles. How do you shrink those cycles and make them meaningful? The strongest people in the gym are those willing to push to failure on lifts. If you're not going there you're not improving as fast as you might. If I can theorize about something for 6 months or try a test that will give me an answer in 3 months guess which I'm doing? Even if it's painful. Yes, even if I fail. At the end of that 6 month period I'm no longer theorizing. I've got an answer and have had 3 additional months to move forward. Sweet.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Visualize. Then GO!</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>It's important to be deliberate and thoughtful in what one is doing. When deadlifting I'm constantly calculating how much I did and should do next. But as an athlete it's impossible to operate in a theater of chatter and head noise. Think, meditate, visualize on how this thing is going to go. And then commit and shut it off. The times I'm least effective are when chatter and operation co-exist.</li>
</ul>
I've found tracking to be such a pain - notebooks or Evernotes filled with random dates of lifts. Anyway I built a little app to track my metrics as I go here (below). Basically it'll take my weight, weight lifted and reps to back into my single rep maximum (using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">Brzycki</a> method). From that it'll calculate my bodyweight multiple and track it over time. I find it satisfying to see how that particular metric moves. It also helps keep it real since I weigh significantly less than folks I lift with at the gym so it acts as a normalizer.  I'll link to it for those interested as soon as I get a chance to deploy it off my local machine. Stay tuned!
