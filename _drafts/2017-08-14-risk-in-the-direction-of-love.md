<blockquote>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you <em>not</em> to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. --Marianne Williamson</blockquote>
Today my ambition went away. I sometimes cling to ambition like a life raft (notice this is a struggle metaphor, not a friendly embrace). Like it'll save me, help me keep my edge. But all I wanted was to be with my kids.<!--more-->

Then a shock of fear came. If felt like a tightening slipknot. Fast breathing:
<ul>
 	<li>ambition lost -&gt; can't feed kids -&gt; lose house -&gt; bad schools -&gt; family suffers -etc.</li>
</ul>
Then, the rationalized flip side:
<ul>
 	<li>Regret maximization: being 80 and wondering "so how good could I have been"?</li>
</ul>
Both produced profound anxiety.

But then a bit of daylight. A re-frame. Ask: what if were to simply eliminate ambition as a criteria? Kill it, and simply optimize on merging work with play. Ensure the work experience is as direct an overlap with daily pleasures as possible (another way of putting it is to ask: what would I do if I was rich?). I suspect in the end the sweet spot of a life well lived, happiness+success, is some combination of daily play and moving towards our strengths.

The heuristic I've recently been using is asking a question: where do I make enough money to support my family, have toys I want, and create the biggest wake of enthusiasm when I walk in the door at night to rush over my kids?

I've decided not to compromise on that. If the day is not pleasurable from the outset for too many days then I'll change it. It's that simple. Fear complacency. Fear being defensive. Risk in the direction of love.
