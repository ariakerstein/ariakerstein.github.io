Realizations while swimming in the pacific:
<ul>
 	<li>There are few things worse than standing up to or just above your genitals in 50 something degree waters</li>
 	<li>Standing waist high really sucks</li>
 	<li>So if you're going to do it then jump in! Get fully immersed as quickly as you can. Commit! Your body will handle the rest.</li>
</ul>
