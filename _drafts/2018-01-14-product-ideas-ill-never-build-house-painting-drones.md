<strong>Context</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Home painting is time and labor intensive, expensive and error prone (in the case of inexperienced college painters). The majority of that cost comes in the form of setup, equipment/ladders etc, and human labor. The actual painting is not very costly.</li>
</ul><!--more-->

<b>Goals</b>:
<ul>
 	<li>Reduce the overall effort, cost and time involved in painting the exterior of a home. It's a pain.</li>
</ul><b>Personas and pain points</b>:
<ul>
 	<li>As a home owner with wooden exteriors (that are in otherwise good shape, e.g., not peeling) and that just need a color change. Admittedly this is a smaller segment of the market but you gotta start somewhere.</li>
</ul><b>Solutions</b>:
<ul>
 	<li>Leverage machine vision to identify the parts that need to be painted and which color (if multiples). This could be done for example by taking a snapshot of the exterior and using a program to paint it the color you want. Those instructions are then uploaded to the drone.</li>
</ul><strong>Details:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Take a snapshot of the exterior and annotations instructing the drone what is a surface to paint vs. e.g., windows, downspouts etc. Photoshop or similar.</li>
 	<li>The software is programmed to tell you specifically how much surface area, hence how many cans of paint are needed to simplify cost structure.</li>
 	<li>The drone is outfitted with top of the line paint sprayers - easily calculate how much paint it can hold and fly with at any given time.</li>
 	<li>Fill the drone with the paint and let it go.</li>
 	<li>Optimize for weather conditions so that paint has sufficient time to dry (rain tomorrow blocks the drone from doing the job).</li>
</ul>
