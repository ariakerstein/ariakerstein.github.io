We travel by Buick leaving suburban safety behind. The car pulled into the reserved spot, “For management only”, it read. My father and I step out and walk toward the building. I’m 12 years old and I’m going to work.

It takes 40 seconds to walk from car seat to factory entrance. In that time my brain floods with feelings, ideas and a hell of a lot of confusion. I look up as I walk. The hum of activity I know is happening in the subterranean city-block was masked by the single-story, white façade of the entrance - tip of an iceberg.

I’m the only kid here. That’s only the most obvious difference. Others include that I’m not here because I need to support my family. To say I want to be here is a stretch, but it was my choice. I’m here because it’s the best option I could think of to the question, “What will you do with your summer?”. I was acting in accord with my loathing of suburban comfort. I didn’t fit in anywhere and resented the activities my peer groups were doing with their families (fancy camps, country clubs, etc). This was my mild form of protest. No, I come from workers. I wanted to work, and learn about it. I was pulled to this place. I needed to find out why. 

This was the factory my grandfather had built into one of the top metallizing and electroplating plants in the country. Millions of pieces efficiently processed, put in plain view and seldom noticed. Metallizing? Electroplating? Pick your head up a moment. It’s likely you’re within 10 feet of such a piece, think: coat hangers, lighting fixtures, reflectors, toy trophies, handles, thermos caps, lipstick tubes, knobs, bottle caps, computer logos.

On the walk over my identity tied itself into knots: grandson of the revered ‘Nat’, holder of many patents, president of the chemical society and iron-fisted leader of this place; son of the lead engineer; sheltered private school nerd coming to see how the other side lives (my personal race condition - in which I thought about what I thought they were thinking about me)?
We passed the men standing outside. They were focused on coffees and cigarettes. They dressed in tough materials: coveralls, jackets, beanie caps, shaggy beards. I had no idea what they were talking about. It was 5:05am, a cool start to a balmy June day in Rhode Island.

We enter the heavy glass doors with a strong pull. The lobby is carpeted, beige and non-descript. This is a place of unstated divisions. One of those fault lines, to put it simply, is that separating above from below. Upstairs is where the executives and their secretaries operate. My family, that is, apart from my father. Downstairs is for laborers, workers: loud, dark, dirty. If you were inclined toward identifications, like a butterfly collector, the straightest line would be through the hands: palm lines etched with dark stains indicated time spent below.

A dark wooden door leads to the narrow stairwell, the kind you might expect when visiting a friend’s house. The stairs themselves are covered in circular lilly pads extruded from the purple rubber. Maybe that helps with grip? The doorway leads to dangling clear plastic like you might find at a grocery freezer section to keep the cold air in. I imagined it was an airlock at the threshold of an expansive world of metal. I take a large step down and leave the familiar. I bounce atop a steel sheet. The heavy metal squares forming the man-made terrain bowed with tension, each one sealed to its neighbor with crude tack-welds. I bounced with each step - not quite the moon, but that’s the idea - energy transferring from the springy silver slabs through my hard-soled boots and through my body. The vapor solvents overwhelm me for a minute. Hot paint fumes mixed with other harsh industrial chemicals, degreasers and masculine morning routines - aftershave.

The noise startles me for a moment, until I adjust. The persistent hum of heavy machines is punctuated by loud beeps. Humans shouting mundane orders to each other over the background noise. Tinny, high-pitched intercom vibrations cut through everything and bounce off the metallic surfaces. “Manny 62346, Manny 62346”. Click! Phones were strategically placed around the factory, physical addresses describing the maze. The message was a catenation of location + person. If your name was called you would walk over to that phone’s location. Someone needed help there. The most frequently called name was ‘Moti’, my father. That was a source of pride. He knew every bit of machinery. In fact, he had built or conceived most of them.

But that was the only pride I felt. I felt awkward in new ways. These men were struggling for survival and I was here out of, what, curiosity? The sensory overwhelm was amplified by awe. How could a person conceive, let alone build something so strange, complicated - and yes – wonderful? 
Questions to consider as I walked:
-   Environment: where did so much steel come from? How did it get here?
-   Machines: There were so many. What did they all do? How did they work?
-   Operations: there was a potent mix of seeming chaos, but there was obvious logic around how all this was coordinated. But I just couldn’t grasp what it was.
-   Jobs: what jobs were required? What exactly did everyone do? Which mattered the most? Who got the most respect?  
-   People: who were these people I was working alongside? Why were they here? Did they enjoy this work?
-   Customers: who was buying this stuff anyway? How did they find the factory?
-   Numbers: so many pieces of plastic everywhere! Each piece needed to be handled, molecules of paint affixed to them with minimal waste. How are they all kept orderly? 
 
The first order of business as we crossed that threshold was for my father to confer with the foreman, and decide where I’d be working for the next 6 hours. My small body filled with a giddy excitement as I waited - a new day, a new area. I had no say in the matter but it didn’t really matter. I loved how different this place was from so much of what I hated at home. 
Each room in this factory was a different world: a different vibe, set of characters and values. Would the room have a poster of scantily clad female flesh behind a tool chest? Would there be a radio playing modern rock, oldies? What types of machines would they use? 

There was only one quiet place here. It was on the third floor. The assembly tables where (almost without exception) the women would work. They would wrap small plastic pieces in copper wire attached to heavy square racks. Once all slots were filled, the racks were handed to a (without exception) large man who would place them onto industrial-grade dollies. The dollies were then rolled across the metallic floors (aha! The metal floors help these dollies roll!) to take the pieces to ovens for baking.

You might think these are all factory workers, all the same kind of person. That would be inaccurate. There were distinctive subcultures that transcended ethnic group (blacks, whites, Indians, and Cape Verdians). What I observed was the cultures seemed to be more forged by discipline or work area than by cultural affiliation.

For example, a machining room would value precision and process. A paint assembly line room would value efficiency of motion to reduce latency and optimize throughput. Then there were the immersion baths that sat on large areas of palates arranged in circular patterns. These areas were controlled mostly by large muscular black men. They would lift large racks of metal and dunk them, assisted by some crane-like machines, into baths filled with colored solutions. There it seemed raw strength was most important. I recall walking through these areas with my father and nearly passed out smelling the solvents. I couldn’t imagine what spending a day so close to such toxic stuff could do to a person.

Today, welding. We walk down a familiar corridor but turn a corner toward an alley I hadn’t seen before. Staccato blue electricity rips the air, illuminating the otherwise dark room. I cover my ears as we approach. We enter the shop. I notice a man covering his face with a black mask. I look down to avoid, what, blindness? 
The lightning stops. I slowly pull my palms off my ears, making sure. Still silence. I look up. The man slides the mask above his head and inspects his work by eye. A pause, then.

“Moti. How are you. Who is this?” he asks, looking at me.
“This is my son. He’ll be helping you today. Please put him to work. If he misbehaves you know where to find me.” A laugh. 
“Sure thing. Ok kid, you got a name?”. He extends a giant hand and we shake. 
“Ari”, I managed.
“Let’s have some fun.” He said. My name is “Big Bird”. I didn’t ask him why they called him that but he does resemble an ostrich with his curly blond hair and large glasses. I immediately associated him with Sesame Street. 
….
“So what do you like to do kid?”, he asked. I looked up.
“Not sure. I kind of like working with my hands.” I said.
“Nah”, he cut in, “you got better things coming, kid. You don’t want to be like me, or these guys. Look at us”. He had a point. But I was fixated on fitting in and felt like admitting that I really wanted to do science would out me as different. I’d never be able to bridge the gap. Engineering seemed like a good middle-ground for us to connect on.
“I mean that I like to build things” I said.
“That’s good, kid”....
