This might be the most ironic title ever. To meditate is to be mindful, slow and calm. Tic toc is the opposite. 

You might believe that Tic Toc is going to destory our cultural values, 15 seconds at a time. 

Emergent technologies are never accidental. 



 There are no technological accidents. Rather, technologies surface at unexpected times. They always reveal something fundamental, sometimes inconvenient, about who we are. 

What I think is at the core of the judgments (at least the ones I've heard in my own circles) is the idea of consideration. My dictionary: <i>Careful thought, typically over a period of time </i>

Tic Toc is the opposite. It's fun, dumb, and thoughtless - a mirror to all that is wrong with society today. Damn kids! The danger here is in three parts:
* Visceral - when we think less things go wrong.  
* Organic
* Thoughtless - I think there's a notion that it's hacking the worst demons in our nature. Next stop: Hell in a handbasket.  

Or is it? That's the superficial view. But let's go deeper. Hypothetical questions:
* What happens when all our news comes in the form of Tic Toc videos? 
* What would it look like if our key decisions happened at a Tic Toc timeframe? 

Let's consider the incumbent (least as of 10 years ago).

I think a chart might help illustrate this.
