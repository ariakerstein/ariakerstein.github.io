[Approaching binary] 

I'll tell you about the time I became an android. It was the day I first balanced on a bike. I kept crashing into in rough bushes in the driveway. But then, magic, I passed those bushes but instead of bracing for impact I relaxed. Magic! I cruised right by and all the pieces came together. my body learned to make it all work. Now I could focus my eyes. Instinctively I trained them on the space just above the "predator" handlebars. Lines separating concrete slabs became guidelines and I became an android on a mission. There was no higher level purpose except for the activity of following the lines. I was a cybernetic soldier ready for orders. 

How is this relevant? Follow me.
