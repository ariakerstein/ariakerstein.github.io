title: incompleteness theorem
---

The days feel incomplete. For each day I complete my tasks and priorities and yet go to bed empty. What causes completeness? What are those conditions so I can replicate them?
completeness-promoting:
  - sex
  - connection with friends
  - some achievement, overcoming an obstacle
  - recornition by peers on something
Incompleteness-promoting:
  - striving with no result
