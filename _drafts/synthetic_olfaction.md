## Opportunity

Current systems for AR/VR focus on the visual and audio. But when it comes to evoking primal reactions and memory the olfactory system is both the oldest system (reptilian brain) and perhaps the most visceral. Layering olfaction into virtual experiences will more fully immerse users and create genuine experience.


## What is it

A system for capturing and reconstituting smell. The system would synthesize molecules detectable by human olfaction (by definition XX PPM). The general idea is that these molecules could be (re)constituted, like a printer prints infinite pictures using a limited pallet of 3 ink types.

There are two parts that can be seen as independent to start. But that would ultimately interact in interesting ways.

1. Capture


2. Reconstitution
  * The molecular fingerprint would be saved in a canonical instruction type (tbd how that'll work exactly). The scent would be synthesized and ejected from a cartridge-like system.   

## Market size / Opportunity

Large. Everyone smells.


## Goals - measuring success

## Who is it for (who desperately needs this?)

The primary use-case is for VR systems to evoke reality in greater dimensions. This is essentially a new type of camera, albeit for olfaction instead of / in addition to visual capture.

## Solution
