<strong>Why Corewheels?</strong>
I invented and developed Corewheels to make bodyweight training more accessible. As a competitive multi sport athlete in high-school, college and then as an adult I've always attributed a favorable strength/weight ratio and lack of injuries to this type of training.
So the goal was to cut through some confusion of how to workout and popularize a highly efficient training modality.

<strong>Who are they for?</strong>
I used to think the Corewheels primary audience was athletes. But then I found this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/corewheels/">great instagram content.</a>Â If you're interested in building your body into an efficient machine - think strength to weight ratio which matters for sports like climbing, Jiu Jitsu/martial arts, rowing, gymnastics then this is for you.

<strong>What's the latest?</strong>
Corewheels are an 'Amazon Choice' product and count among the users the US military, pro athletes/trainers and everyday people trying to live a healthier lifestyle. You can find Corewheels at your local sporting goods shop (Sports Authority, Dicks, Big 5, etc.). And of course you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SKLZ-Wheels-Dynamic-Strength-Trainer/dp/B00C81JUS2">buy them on Amazon</a>.
