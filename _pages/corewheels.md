I developed Corewheels to provide users a super efficient no BS strength training product. As a semi competitive athlete in high-school and college and beyond I've always found body-weight/leverage based workouts to be the most efficient use of my time. Think Pilates or Gymnastics workouts without all the equipment or space. 

Anyway I've licensed the product twice, had an informercial (you really don't want to see it) and count among the users the US military, pro athletes and everyday people trying to live a healthier lifestyle. 

You can find corewheels on most sporting goods shops (sports authority, Dicks, etc) and of course you can [buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SKLZ-Wheels-Dynamic-Strength-Trainer/dp/B00C81JUS2).
