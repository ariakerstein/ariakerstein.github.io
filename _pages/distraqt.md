**Organizing the world's attention.**


- Customer pain: As a busy professional I need more deep work in week so that I can be more effective. There's nothing more frustrating than blocking off 3 hours to focus and feel like I didn't maximize that time to get things done.


- Solution: Distraqt will help you: 
     - focus when you're on task
     - plan your focused time with 'flow blocks'
     - Generate insights on how you spent your flow time

Advanced praise for Distraqt:
> How do you think I was able to focus long enough to forumlate relativity theory? Everyone loves that I was also a musician but let me tell you that violin habit really wasn't helping. 

-Einstein

> The only way I could focus in that tin can long enough to get to the moon. 

-Neil Armstrong
