This was a final project for a data modeling course using SAS (...that I took for fun in evenings....draw your own conclusions about my social life).

The purpose of this project was to examine the major factors affecting the cost of flying a passenger per mile (CPM). I examined 6 different independent variables and 24 derived variables, finally settling on 3 different OLS models based on length of flight and the size of the craft.
Turns out the most important factors in the data are the load factor and the number of seats per aircraft.

Attached is a summary.
