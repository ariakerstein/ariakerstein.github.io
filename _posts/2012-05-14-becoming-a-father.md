Tonight I had a realization. Saul was on the change table, I was cupping his tiny head in my hand. He started to coo. He was speaking baby. No meaning to the words, but importance - to him. The imperative of life is to express it's will. That will could be free or genetically determined. Either way, that's the point. Not the content of the expression, but rather it's existence.

Saul teaches me things already.
