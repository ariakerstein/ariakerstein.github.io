Let the other 6 days be for striving. But since striving never ends, the Sabbath is a stake in the ground to acknowledge that life is to be appreciated. And taking time to acknowledge the hidden forces - call it god or whatever you like - in our lives is critical to finding contentment. Achievement does not necessarily equal contentment;Â but setting aside the space to enjoy the fruits of our labor will at least serve as a mechanism to promote it.
