  I’ve noticed quite a lot of folks in my own network (self included) that I would call highly introspective. But ironically that introspection sometimes gets in the way of effectiveness and tends toward a blissing out on self-criticism. This is awful not only because it doesn&#8217;t accomplish anything positive, but also because it entrenches unhelpful narratives. Fire has been discovered but it’s burning uncontrollably, threatening the forest.

  In my view deep introspection is a key element of a well lived and impactful life. So here’s some thoughts on harnessing that power and putting it to work.

  Here’s an outline the causes of effective introspection (I&#8217;ll try to revisit and add some skin to the bones later):
</div>

  * Use a framework 
      * Select an issue to focus on
      * 5 whys if you’re diagnosing some issue
  * Visualize 
      * retrospective: review your day, your interactions. Ask: what went well, what could I have done better.
      * future: daydream on _What ifs&#8230;_
      * physical: use imagery and
      * empower: try and get into a positive mindset. This requires some deeper understanding about your own triggers &#8211; what to avoid for negativity, what to engage to promote positivity.
  * Objectivity vs. subjectivity 
      * focus on what’s within your circle of control vs. circumstances.
