But underlying great accomplishments are foundational systems and organizing your notes is one of the most important.</p><p name="09a4" id="09a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A proper organization system will enable the interrogation of notes — a critical factor toward improving flows, maintaining a historical record of activities, and building on fragmented ideas. A good system makes recurring tasks like quarterly summaries, annual reviews etc. become literally a matter of looking through notes and jogging the memory (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what did I actually do this year? What did my team achieve this quarter, etc.</em>).</p><ol class="postList"><li name="41c9" id="41c9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Use Evernote to capture everything, including paper notes</strong></li></ol><p name="1009" id="1009" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">So what makes an effective note organization system? It needs to solve for 2 things, recording and recall: Do I know where to put an item (spending less than say 3–5 seconds on deciding), and can I quickly/thoughtlessly retrieve it. By the way you can do this with many different folder systems (e.g., dropbox) but as the title indicates Evernote is my strongly preferred tool if for no other reason that I can VERY easily search all content easily, including handwritten notes — winning on retrieval.</p><p name="1833" id="1833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it comes to setup, Evernote is un-opinionated in how new users onboard. I don’t think this is a good thing in that many new users miss the point and abandon. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It’s just notes, how hard can it be!</em> I had Evernote installed for over a year before I started getting hooked which happened via painful trial and error tinkering to develop a system.</p><p name="7bd1" id="7bd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the power of using Evernote as your one system is that it can easily handle various media. For example I love legal pads and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Classic-Notebook-Large-Notebooks/dp/8883701127" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Classic-Notebook-Large-Notebooks/dp/8883701127" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moleskine notebooks</a> to generate (record) notes. But while paper works as a creation/archival system it is prone to loss, fire and flood and at least for me is terrible for quick access since I’m bad about maintaining physical filing systems. I’ll still hold onto them in shoebox form since there’s something nice about having the physical artifact but that’s where it ends. Evernote makes it easy to upload pictures or scan in files which then makes it more easily accessible. Typically I’ll snap pics at the end of the day of any paper notes to get it in. Enough preamble. Other benefits:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="050d" id="050d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Snap pics of your paper notes or whiteboard scribblings. Evernote actually works great in <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2015/06/23/6-ways-evernote-embraces-handwriting/" data-href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2015/06/23/6-ways-evernote-embraces-handwriting/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">searching handwriting.</a></li><li name="cb42" id="cb42" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Clip media from the web with the <a href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/" data-href="https://evernote.com/webclipper/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">web clipper</a></li><li name="906b" id="906b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Embed voice memos/sound into notes (e.g., when you’re in a meeting or interviewing candidates).</li></ul><p name="f51a" id="f51a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Define your notebooks</strong></p><p name="4cef" id="4cef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Define notebooks such that they are close to <a href="http://www.caseinterview.com/mece" data-href="http://www.caseinterview.com/mece" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MECE</a> for your own life (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive). Note I maintain a ‘reference’ notebook which is basically an ‘everything else’ place for miscellany. I haven’t seen a compelling argument for use of stacks, or a notebook of notebooks. While there are good arguments for minimizing notebook count, I do find something very pleasing about having notebooks right in front of me for ease of retrieval and reminding myself about the important things in play. This closely mirrors the organizing principle from Mythbusters’ Adam Savage, who advocates use of <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/inside-adam-savages-toolbox/" data-href="https://www.wired.com/2012/08/inside-adam-savages-toolbox/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">First Order Retrievability</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">. </em>I find that saved searches, notebook stacks, overuse of nested tags etc., adds a layer of complexity that increases my cognitive overload and reduces my recording and recall efficiency. Also this can bring on second order issues like cleaning up tags or re-classification that can end up being more trouble than value add.</p><p name="e99b" id="e99b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alright, so here’s what my notebook setup looks like:</p><figure name="45f6" id="45f6" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 548px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 104.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*YkeOUzB1fznOzZv1zv4XLA.png" data-width="1084" data-height="1132" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*YkeOUzB1fznOzZv1zv4XLA.png"></div></figure><ul class="postList"><li name="c3b0" id="c3b0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure">I have several notebooks representing fractal time-scales which is a fancy way of saying I organize my time in a pattern like 5 year goals/annual goals/quarterly goals/weekly goals/daily goals.</li><li name="a6a8" id="a6a8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">More GTD — implement one notebook each for Projects and Someday projects. I’ve found this to be a great distinction to keep all my ‘really great ideas’ in check. ‘Projects’ is for current projects that are <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">in progress</em> — typically one note for each project at a high level to keep the objective, vision and values in mind. I’ll add other notes as needed. ‘Someday projects’ is for project ideas that aren’t a current priority to at least free up those neurons for something useful. I try to review these periodically if just to turn the soil of my ideas.</li></ul><figure name="f721" id="f721" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--li"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 421px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 80.30000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*QB1oonwbukBPA3cVF5WggQ.png" data-width="1742" data-height="1398" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*QB1oonwbukBPA3cVF5WggQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">hot tip: save your Kindle highlights to a sepearate books notebook</figcaption></figure><ul class="postList"><li name="41c0" id="41c0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure">BookNotes. As an avid reader on kindle I can grab all my highlights and dump them here. This took some time to figure out but in case you’re interested I recently discovered <a href="http://www.norbauer.com/bookcision/" data-href="http://www.norbauer.com/bookcision/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bookcision</a> which is a real timesaver in terms of downloading all notes from a book. So I havea single notebook containing one note each per book with all highlights. What’s great is I can summarize my commentary, learnings at the top of the note. So when I’m waiting in line I can quite literally re-read the best parts of my favorite books. To quote Warren Buffett: <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">read 500 pages…every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.</em></li><li name="bac2" id="bac2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Home notebook. Here’s where my wife and I share notes.

Things that go here include things like grocery lists, medical/insurance info, doctors visit notes, emergency info for kids, etc.</li><li name="fc72" id="fc72" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">And miscellaneous specific notebooks for things that are important (and this changes over time). Some example notebooks I use: great recipes, general work stuff, Camping and travel, essays/writing, iterations (scrum), courses I’m taking, etc. This is always evolving but the point is that these live in their own world and easy to quickly access and input notes into. A notebook should warrant enough notes and ongoing activity to stand on it’s own. That’s pretty fuzzy but it works for me.</li></ul><p name="cd06" id="cd06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. Tag your notes and use shortcuts for frequently accessed notes</strong></p><p name="31ee" id="31ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Use tags to combine information that spans across different notebooks. I’ve found that I can keep in mind a dozen notebooks, but not hundreds of tags which simplifies the <a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005347-How-to-save-email-into-Evernote" data-href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005347-How-to-save-email-into-Evernote" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nifty email feature</a>, from the Evernote blog:</p><blockquote name="4fb5" id="4fb5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">@Notebook: </strong>Notes will go into your default notebook unless you specify one using the at (@) symbol and notebook name, such as @travel. You do not need quotes if you have a space in the notebook title. For example, you would write @International Travel or @My Notebook.</blockquote><blockquote name="6639" id="6639" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">#Tag: </strong>Add tags using the pound or hashtag (#) symbol, such as #manchester #england</blockquote><figure name="58e3" id="58e3" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--blockquote"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 474px; max-height: 510px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 107.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5zed5doqigcIKCcNe2mIww.png" data-width="474" data-height="510" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5zed5doqigcIKCcNe2mIww.png"></div></figure><p name="6621" id="6621" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Some folks use tags nearly exclusively for organization and keep notebooks to a minimum. For a good perspective on a <a href="https://byrslf.co/using-evernote-the-right-way-ef61f530d1ad#.l5rvsx9pv" data-href="https://byrslf.co/using-evernote-the-right-way-ef61f530d1ad#.l5rvsx9pv" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tag-based approach read this</a>. My own flow is to tag liberally and to pull the important tags into my shortcuts so I can access them easily without polluting my notebooks. In practice that means notes that I want to review or access are one click away — nice and clean!</p><p name="a637" id="a637" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other benefit of using tags is for ad-hoc searches. A good use-case to see this in action is for filing taxes. I’ll generate a tag called e.g.,“2015-taxes” and label all relevant notes or snippets as they’re created. This will let me quickly pull up all notes needed for filing taxes and obviate remembering each note individually. e.g., receipts from one notebook, financial statements from another, confirmation codes in the form of a screenshot from a third.</p><p name="d2f6" id="d2f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of the tags I’ve found over time to be most useful include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1c24" id="1c24" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--p">‘++’ for anything that’s super important and accessed frequently. This is helpful for reminders and notes to self…lessons that just won’t sink into my thick skull (stop giving unsolicited advice — oh well). Also I keep a small set of checklists and bigger goals/values here as I’ve found that referring to these daily really helps ground me. Having annual goals right in front of me engenders frequent reviews and refinements. I can’t overstate how important it is to review annual or ‘higher’ level goals to combat the tyranny of minutia.</li><li name="f1ef" id="f1ef" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--li">‘Templates’, ‘checklists’, for templates I frequently use. This is a nice shortcut for things like daily or weekly templates, lists of stuff for camping trips etc. I copy from here into the relevant notebook instead from starting from scratch. More on this below.</li><li name="70f6" id="70f6" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--li">‘GTD’ files for things like Next actions in context (@computer, @phone, @home, etc.). If you’re not familiar with this system, <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd/" data-href="https://hamberg.no/gtd/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s a great quick primer on GTD.</a> Also here are things like articles etc. for reading, review that I haven’t gotten to in the week. I drop them in here.</li><li name="4189" id="4189" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Touchbase is for weekly 1:1 meetings with my team so I can keep track of what we spoke about last week, what’s coming up, and keep a running log of open issues etc. This is extra useful as a tag since I don’t need a separate notebook for each of these— they can exist wherever the right place (in this case the work notebook) and I can surface the note itself quickly and easily without searching.</li></ul><p name="3011" id="3011" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4. Create Templates for recurring activities (and </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">DRY</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">!).</strong></p><p name="6cbe" id="6cbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you happen across or develop a great formula, framework or recipe you’ll want to capture and refine it. I’ve always had a peculiar obsession with codifying learnings. I’ve found that generating templates that I then instantiate for a circumstance works really well as a workflow. For example I’ve iterated on the daily review template below for years and it’s always changing. But this works because I use it every day. Implementing these types of systems can be a real time saver. For example when I was at a small startup I would do a lot of customer research and interviewing. I developed a handful of interview templates that I would refine and share with others. Nailing down air tight systems here really kept things smooth and helped me free up mental space to engage with the subject. So I developed a field interview template to score someone’s willingness to use my app. Here’s a random sampling of templates that have worked for me over the years.</p><figure name="c182" id="c182" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 536px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 102.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yABLCE9on36Red1gyo7ulw.png" data-width="1456" data-height="1486" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*yABLCE9on36Red1gyo7ulw.png"></div></figure><ul class="postList"><li name="a885" id="a885" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure">Daily Review template. I’ll copy the master template and title the new version always “YY-MM-DDDD” to keep it in chronological order. Occasionally I’ll include a memorable picture of the day for fun (which shows in the snippets view which is great for jogging my memory). BTW, this has evolved as a hybrid of best practices I’ve taken over the years ranging from <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/" data-href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Allen’s GTD</a>, to Tony <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/" data-href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robbins</a>, Tim <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" data-href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ferriss</a>, Stephen <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/" data-href="https://www.stephencovey.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Covey</a>, and many others. The goal here is not to convince you to adopt this template which happens to work really well for me but to develop ones that work for you consistently.</li><li name="9993" id="9993" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Weekly review template, Quarterly review template. This ‘rolls up’ the days for a view on the week, and the weeks to the quarter. The most consistent part of GTD for me is the weekly review which really does help to get a virtuous feedback loop in place. Here I’ll review my goals for the quarter, where I spent my time during the week, learnings, areas to improve, etc. and decide how to carry those learnings forward.</li><li name="466a" id="466a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Usability testing Q&amp;A tests for interviewing customers.</li><li name="e4bb" id="e4bb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Grocery lists with staple foods since I tend to eat the same foods consistently.</li><li name="075b" id="075b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">and etc. <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Sky is the limit here.</em></li></ul><p name="220b" id="220b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5.

I tend to tweak them each time I access them. There’s no right way here. Again, lots of this is particular to how I like to work. But I hope looking at my own workflow will give you ideas on implementing your own system for an awesome 2017.</p><p name="fb1d" id="fb1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">To summarize:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="f384" id="f384" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Capture everything into Evernote (paper, whiteboard, voice notes)</li><li name="339f" id="339f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Define your notebooks to reflect your priority areas</li><li name="dc58" id="dc58" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Tag your notes and make use of shortcuts for frequently accessed notes</li><li name="c84b" id="c84b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Create templates for recurring activities</li><li name="cdff" id="cdff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Rinse, repeat and refine over time</li></ul><p name="4f15" id="4f15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">So that’s it.
