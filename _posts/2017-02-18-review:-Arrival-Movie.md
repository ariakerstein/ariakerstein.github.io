Best scifi movie I've seen in a very long time. Here's what impacted me:
- the notion of memory as non-linear
- the notion of language as non-linear. Sound does seem so clunky when you think about it
- the importance of memories with those we love. 
- Q: If you could see your life start to finish, would you change anything?
- the importance of doing what we are meant to do and living authentically
