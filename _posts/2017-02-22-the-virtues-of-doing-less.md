title: The Virtues of Doing Less
---

As an aggressive type-A, sometimes with a chip on your shoulder the tendency is to do more. But the secret to success is sometimes to do less. Why? 3 reasons:

- Better focus and planning. To do exactly what you set out to requires that you know what needs doing in the first place. While this is not always realistic for new projects, if you understand what you're getting into this should be 80% dialed-in.

- Better reward when done. If your goals are concretely defined then you can more easily celebrate the milestones. This is easy for the full project. But the real secret is to celebrate the daily/micro wins. If you've planned out the blocks well then these should be celebrated too!

- Actually get more done - move into the next goal!. Have the courage to complete your goals or to cut them as mission critical. If you've made no progress on your goal and keep kicking the proverbial can down the road then it may be time to either modify your approach or cut and move on. You have a lifetime of goals ahead of you - don't pay a dear opportunity cost if you don't have to.
