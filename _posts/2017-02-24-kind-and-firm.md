I've been taking a parenting class based on [Positive discipline](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QWZJI6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). The book offers real insights into parenting so I highly recommend it. But what I found myself stuck on was some language - kindness. They advocate balancing kind and firm. Thinking more about it I realize that kindness is sort of a squishy word. But kindness and firmness actually feel like they contradict.

Consider the following use-case. A 2 year old kicks over an 18 month old kid on the playground. It happens a lot. Parent of the older being 'kind' says something like "oh, johnny. That's not nice. Let's not do that again." And then she moves on with johnny to some other area. Another area, another unsuspecting victim. She probably thought she was being kind, perhaps equating conflict avoidance or lack of stern voice as kindness. No! Totally wrong. There was nothing kind about that moment. What could have been a learning opportunity was wasted. How many more such events need to happen? What's wrong with this is:
a) Mother avoided doing the hard job of actually parenting.
b) Kid missed out on a learning opportunity.

What would have kindness looked like in that situation? How about checking on the 18mo, pulling 2yo aside and reminding him about basic decency/right vs. wrong and decomposing the actions to see what happened. Then bring the kids together, johnny offering an apology and making it better. Something like that.

For me the word 'kindness' is problematic. I think of it more like empathy. That fits better. What the mom did in this situation was 'permissive' not kind. Kindness for me feels superficial - like it's the action that happens. Empathy speaks, to me at least, about the underlying motivation of caring and understanding the feelings of the participants. With that in mind the actual actions are easier to get at and not obscured by a need to come across as kind, not stern.

I realize I'm ranting a bit here but the point is that if the motivation is of empathy for all then a bit of sternness is ok. There is no contradiction.
