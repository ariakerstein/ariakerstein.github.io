How you exercise is a metaphor for how you live your life. Does your routine consist of a regimented program or is it off the cuff? Do you even have a routine? Do you plan or do you just show up? Do you do yoga? Mix cardio with strength training in a sensible balance? Do you figure it out for yourself or do you study the literature? Do you listen to your body or just listen to the magazines? Do you track what you're doing?<!--more-->

Lately I've simplified. I do squats, deadlifts, pull-ups and corewheels 2 days a week. The other days I run. That's basically it - hard compound movements so I maximize strength and can ensure I'm improving. Measuring improvement is hard when you're doing many things. Then I get out in a fraction of the time. The point is to encourage self discipline, get strong, get high, (and maybe look good as a side benefit).

How do you exercise? Does it reflect your approach to life or is it just something you try to get through?
