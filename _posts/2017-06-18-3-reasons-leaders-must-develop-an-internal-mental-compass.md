As a kid dealing with stressful home circumstances I realized that I had a choice: I could respond to these situations in my normal way by getting anxious, or I could instead try converting that energy to something useful. The way I did this was basically to feel that emotion and then map that context to a different emotion - I chose excitement. <!--more-->It felt easy at the time (I was 9 or 10, very malleable brain) but it's more elusive to describe and I won't go deeper here.

Anyway, years later as a leader at a large company this came in handy. I got a charge from the uncertainty ahead which allowed me to stay mentally sharp versus what happened as a kid - basically to thrash around in my head. Each time I was going through some fire drill or unreasonable deadline at work I was reminded the truth that early adversity, if done right, is a true gift. It was obvious when I was working with colleagues that hadn't done this work - more than once I've seen people break down over coffee or walks.

I recall in one 360 performance review several on my team called me mercurial. The rest of the review was outstanding but I was totally caught off guard. My team was high performing and we had shipped a lot of impactful products over the past several quarters. And the tone in things like retrospectives was overall positive. I played this off as my Israeli side coming out which also had some truth in it.

But when I stepped back it became obvious to me that I could do better. I was in fact coming into the office with high mood variability. What? Didn't I just say that I was good at managing my stress? YES! But the problem it turned out was that if I wasn't in a state of mild stress and excitement with a purpose, a looming goal then I would get bored and need to change something. After we had shipped these major features I had been working on day and night there was something of a vacuum without an overriding goal. This was the result of a mental slump that had set in. I loved my team and the products we were working on but at a higher level I wasn't very happy at work. A crushing bureaucracy was seeping in and covering the light with a film of dust.

What I realized after getting that feedback was that as a manager it's important to consider the broader context of how one's dissatisfaction impacts others. Being a parent and a leader are similar - small cues take on a disproportionate weight and it's important to be mindful of how you're carrying yourself. The great thing about that moment in my professional career was it pointed out this important dimension of my leadership to which I'm now keenly attuned. In retrospect, had I considered any negative impact I was likely having on my team I would have left that role sooner. Being anything - or aspiring to be - less than an outstanding manager is unacceptable. Your tone on conduct sets the mood for the whole team. For me it's clear that if work and play don't coexist in the office to a high degree then I am not living to my own standards.  That's where I'm at my best. A mantra of sorts I've Play your work.

So setting this high emotional stability bar as a manager/leader requires the development of an internal compass around one's emotional management. When I say compass I mean this metaphorically, as in there is a set point ('North') to which the needle quickly resets after some perturbation. This is important for three reasons: personal performance, performance of your directs, Keeping happy in a dynamic world.

<strong>Personal performance.</strong> Getting and processing critical feedback from peers and superiors is a vital part of any leadership function. You cannot operate efficiently in a professional theater if your equilibrium gets thrown every time this happens. Feel it, process it, decide on a plan to incorporate that into your behavior. Then move on. Objective assessment will beat subjective judgments every time: the former is effective, whereas the latter is generally a waste of time. WAY easier said than done.

<strong>Performance of your direct reports.</strong> <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-management-can-become-the-noblest-profession/">Management is the most noble profession</a>. Giving feedback is critical to the success of any team. If a manager is not emotionally stable this WILL spill over onto the lives of direct reports. This in turn will have a ripple effect on the lives of their inner circles and networks. Our lives are interdependent and as a manager you are a central part of someone's life. 8-12 hours of their day are spent in your orbit. More time than they spend with family. Make sure you're up to that task before shouldering the burden.
<blockquote>The only metrics that will truly matter to my life are the individuals whom I have been able to help, one by one, to become better people.” ― <a class="authorOrTitle" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1792.Clayton_M_Christensen">Clayton M. Christensen</a>, <span id="quote_book_link_18876639"><a class="authorOrTitle" href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/18907551">How Will You Measure Your Life?</a></span></blockquote>
<strong>Happiness and balance</strong>. Moving from meeting to meeting on 30 minute blocks is demanding. And meetings can get emotional. You must be able to clear and reset your mental set point. It's important that one can move from one context to another without bringing the baggage of the previous 30 minutes to whatever is next. Otherwise you'll risk a downward spiral as days progress. And there's a purging at the end of the day that needs to happen as one transitions back home, for example to their families after a hard day.

In the end we will measure ourselves not by the destination but by the journey. We are climbing the mountains and only spend a moment at the peak. What was the journey up it like? If all we think about is the peak, spending our time rushing towards the top then we will degrade that experience of getting there for both ourselves and our companions. It'll be less fun. It'll be less effective. And reaching the summit will be less meaningful. The people you work with are what matters in the end. Leverage in getting to the top comes from building the team that can get it done. Success is less about heroic individuality (it has its place) and more about creating the team dynamics to get this done.
