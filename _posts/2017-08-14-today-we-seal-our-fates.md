I walked past a graveyard this morning. Looking over the stones. I stand among the stones.
Each with a name. How much unfinished business was here - and how much did it matter in the end?

Were these men, women, children resurrected I would no doubt fit neatly into the normal curve of abilities. The living - you and I - we're no better than the dead. We're not smarter, better looking, more capable. The difference is the opportunity our pumping blood affords us. Time. Each day we seal our fates.

So take a moment and think about what it is you'll do TODAY with that opportunity. What will you do to nudge your life into a place of meaning, of importance? What will you do for others?  What unfinished business can you put to the side?

What absolutely cannot wait? Do that.
