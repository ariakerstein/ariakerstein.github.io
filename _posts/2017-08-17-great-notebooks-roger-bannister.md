For each workout or goal you need a plan. Here&apos;s one I find especially inspiring. It&apos;s the training diary Roger Bannister kept in the lead up to his breaking the 4 minute mile barrier. This is taken from his book. A few things to notice about his training regimen: <ul><li>Low tech: it&apos;s decidedly low tech/no frills. It&apos;s written on medical notebook paper. </li><li>Efficient: He famously setup a treadmill with a crash pad in his lab (he was a Med student) and worked out at lunch, running usually 30 minutes to full exhaustion until he would fail, then tumble off. Breaking this human barrier did not occupy his full attention - the epitome of doing things smart with a clear goal. </li><li>Focused: it does one thing - track his workouts by day and week.</li></ul><br><img src="http://www.samuelakerstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/copypasteimage.jpg"><br><br>You will only push as hard as your motivation.
