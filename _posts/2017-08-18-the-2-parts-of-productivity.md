It sounds simple to say - and it is - there are two parts to being productive. They are:<ul><li>defining what to do</li><li>Then doing it</li></ul>There&apos;s of course more to it. For example properly sequencing those items, knowing how to carry it out etc. If I find myself in a rut or unsure where my time is going I find it helpful to pop up a level and assess what actually needs to get done. Another way of saying it is that if I&apos;m spinning my wheels it&apos;s likely a result of not knowing what to do. What&apos;s especially helpful is to bring it back to the why. That usually helps bring clarity around the what. There are few things more anxiety provoking than not knowing what to do. And there&apos;s nothing quite as deeply satisfying as executing your part in a well thought through plan.
