What are those magical arenas in your day where you forget your cares and merge with something bigger, something more fun? Where you lose yourself? Where do they happen? In today's connected world one might argue they occur in apps... or that they never happen because of them. Regardless, it's worth taking a minute to jot them down for yourself. Maybe you'll remember to do them once in a while.

For me:
<ul>
 	<li>Reading fiction</li>
 	<li>Staring off into space listening to ambient music (seriously, try it)</li>
 	<li>juggling</li>
 	<li>Giving a talk</li>
 	<li>writing code (ok sometimes)</li>
 	<li>conversations over caffeine</li>
 	<li>Exercise: Running in the park, lifting weights, swimming etc.</li>
 	<li>Playing on the floor with a 3 and 5 year old, and a 7 month old.</li>
</ul>
For Richard Feynman (from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041">"Surely You're Joking..."</a>:
<blockquote>I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling. I had nothing to do, so I start figuring out the motion of the rotating plate. I discovered that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast as the wobble rate—two to one. It came out of a complicated equation! I went on to work out equations for wobbles. Then I thought about how the electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there's the Dirac equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it… the whole business that I got the Nobel prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.</blockquote>
And for you?
