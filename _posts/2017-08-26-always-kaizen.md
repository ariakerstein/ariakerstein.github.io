<p class="p1">We fall back to the systems we've set in place. Competition pushes us beyond our limits.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s an example from running. When I began over a decade ago I would run 3 miles at a time. And I would feel great at the end of it. <!--more-->One day I was just finishing a run and stretching in the parking lot. An older coach approached me and asked if I wanted to join his running group for a short run. I said sure, unaware they were doing timed miles! After doing two of these efforts I was physically crushed (avg. 5:35/mi) and realized my own training was unsound: unstructured, unfocused, and with few systems in place. While running those intervals I realized that running a mile is a very specific activity. The mile stresses BOTH the <a href="http://www.runningforfitness.org/book/chapter-10-putting-it-together/threshold">aerobic and the anaerobic systems</a> (as it tends to exceed 75% of max heart rate).</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve found that having a structure really prevents a tendency to slide backwards and promotes a virtuous circle of upward progress. So from there I joined a running group and went from 3 miles a few times a week to running the Boston marathon 3 times (and counting). By the way I was severely asthmatic as a child and missed many days of school with respiratory issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I overcame this with the discipline my mother imposed in the form of daily swimming. It was horrible. I would constantly get passed by other kids. They do this thing where they slap your feet or grab your ankle to pull you back while they surge ahead. But it was all worth it.</p>
<p class="p1">These days I have a family and finding running partners with the same schedule is not easy. So I’ve developed a new set of habits around my running practice. Think of it as a riff on the carrot and stick. My version is the watch and the competition. It looks something like this:</p>

<p class="p1">I run with a Garmin GPS watch. I program my intervals to ensure I’m getting quality workouts and that runs are focused. While I may be running solo, at night in the SF fog, up a hill (yes, this is what new parents resort to) the watch does have a magical ability to keep me on task. It’s like the coach with a whistle telling you what to do. When I get a running partner that’s when we bring out the competition as only competition can.</p>
<p class="p1">This learning extends beyond the road. In terms of leading product teams it’s a similar story. The systems and processes you put in place will hold a standard. Beyond that it's the team and your colleagues that will push you beyond those limits to achieve your best work.</p>
