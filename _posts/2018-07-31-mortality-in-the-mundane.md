It&#8217;s kind of bizarre to ponder one&#8217;s mortality while looking at a sink full of dirty dishes and sippy cups. The contemplation of death (if you want to get fancy about it,Â [memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori)) always seemed more tastefully done on some epic landscape than in the home. But I guess the idea of epic is what we make it. The power is in us to suffuse our surroundings with the nobility that is our human existence. We create reality, if we want to. Perhaps the hardest thing is to parry the deceptive mirage of the mundane with the noble truth of our mortality.
