My brother Eli and I worked out earlier today at my local gym. I've been trying to get as strong as possible going into this battle so I have reserves to draw on. He had a great suggestion while we were doing heavy deadlifts to track this over time. <!--more-->So basically I plan to science the shit out of this (stealing from one of my recent favorite movies, the Martian).

I've decided to monitor 2 aspects of my health as I go through chemo. The first is monitor my weight and body composition with a wireless scale over the course of this treatment &#8211; I&#8217;ll be using [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B8LEELA/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1). The second is to track my strength loss during this period. I don&#8217;t want to overthink this process so what I&#8217;ll do is track one key lift, the [barbell deadlift](https://stronglifts.com/deadlift/), since I think covers  [80/20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) on total strength. I&#8217;ve established my baseline 1 rep max (238 lb). Since I&#8217;m likely to lose some weight I&#8217;ll normalize this looking as percentage of bodyweight (1.6x) and calculating the theoretical 1rm moving forward. I say theoretical because it&#8217;s probably not advisable to push hard enough to do an actual 1rm during chemo. For reference here&#8217;s the [calculator I&#8217;ll be using. ](https://strengthlevel.com/)

I&#8217;ll establish a stable baseline over the next few days and track this as I go. Here&#8217;s the [spreadsheet I&#8217;ll be using](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I-6J4e5Fou3MLq2mnP0F7E1fn6ofEklnotS49A9nAhI/edit?usp=sharing):
