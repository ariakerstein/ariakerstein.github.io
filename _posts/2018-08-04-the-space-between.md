Improving one&#8217;s quality of life requires expanding the space between stimulus and response (I picked that up at a buddhist lecture years ago and it stuck). For me the tool for doing this is reflection of some sort. This can take the form of sitting meditation, which I love, but more typically occurs while walking, running, swimming in the freezing pacific ocean! <!--more-->Lately though this most occurs between sets of heavy weight lifting. I used to think of strength training in terms of the lift itself. But I&#8217;ve recently come to appreciate the space between sets as my favorite part. You get mentally pumped, an excellent [way to prime](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/priming-exercise/).

This space between is where life&#8217;s inputs get _synthesized and non-obvious connections made_. It&#8217;s where I can decide how to act in an authentic way to life. I think that&#8217;s because that decision would have passed through the imagination &#8211; probably because I do a lot of daydreaming/visualizing between sets (I&#8217;m the guy with the spaced out look staring off in the distance, if you see me say hi). It&#8217;s where I tend to make hard decisions.

And for me this space is where free will lives (never mind  for now if [G-d plays dice](http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html)!). Regardless the circumstance we find ourselves in there always exists the possibility to decide how we will respond. How that response is shaped and executed offers a strong indicator on the quality of one&#8217;s life.

Enough rambling for now.
