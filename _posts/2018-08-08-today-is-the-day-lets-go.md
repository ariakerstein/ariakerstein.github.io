I kickoff my first chemo session in an hour. Feeling very calm overall. The one thing that&#8217;s surfacing for me above all others is a conversation with my son Lev last night. Actually it wasn&#8217;t so much a conversation as him telling me his thoughts.

_Daddy, when I grow up I want to be a surgeon. Because the world needs more surgeons. And surgery is important&#8230;.yeah. And I also want to be a baseball player. And a construction worker&#8230;._

Fuck yea Lev! Why didn&#8217;t I do all those things?! Basically it was fear, apprehension. Self-doubt, thumb sucking (to borrow Warren Buffett&#8217;s terminology). Oy! Whatever it is we commit to we have a choice. We can tip-toe or we can tap-dance through this world toward our goals and dreams. No tip-toeing moments will be missed. And I hope to have fewer of them moving forward. Today certainly is not a day for apprehension. The path forward is clear.Â  Let&#8217;s do this!!
