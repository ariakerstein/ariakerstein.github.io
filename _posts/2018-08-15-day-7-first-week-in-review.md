I&#8217;m one week out from the first infusion &#8211; that&#8217;s 5% of the way to completion, assuming no complications. The first few days were ok, better than expected actually. I slept a full day after getting home from the hospital that first day. On Friday I got up early and actually did a pretty hard workout (my doctor wasn&#8217;t pleased but I felt really good). <!--more-->That feeling of strength continued through the weekend. I was able to get up early a few other days and do some light exercise. My appetite was hearty, sleep was mostly fine and no nausea. There were two minor side effects. The first was heartburn/acid reflux, something I never get. So I started taking 

[prilosec](https://www.prilosecotc.com/en-us) to help (hard to tell if it&#8217;s working so far). The other is what I can only describe as cramping in my stomach. It&#8217;s basically a burning sensation in pockets around my abdomen that I take to be the cancer. While not comfortable there is a satisfaction in being able to feel some tangible effects. The tumor is perceptibly smaller already, which blows my mind. This is further supported by the fact that the constipation I was experiencing (due to the size/location in the abdomen) has improved. This story is corroborated by my doctor who says this is normal/to be expected for the ~10 days post-infusion and that the drugs I&#8217;m on have the effect of &#8220;_liquefying the cancer_&#8220;. I like that image. Medicine is a marvel.

The elevated energy had a lot to do with the prednisone (it amps you up and increases appetite). On the days after stopping the pills I&#8217;ve felt very different. I stopped taking them on Sunday, and starting Monday I&#8217;ve basically been in bed sleeping/too weak to get up with a somewhat suppressed appetite. I clawed myself out of bed to take a walk around the corner and write this post, feel normal. I tried taking a walk yesterday and I had to turn around after a few blocks. Imagine your energy during the worst flu you&#8217;ve had &#8211; that&#8217;s my energy for the past 2-3 days.

Everyone told me I&#8217;d be watching more tv but that hasn&#8217;t been the case so far. With whatever attention I can muster I&#8217;ve been doing more reading. And I&#8217;ve rebooted my meditation practice in earnest, shooting for 30 minutes daily. I&#8217;ve started re-attending a group on Sunday nights that meets for 2 hours. That&#8217;s felt really important actually. We&#8217;ll see if my strength permits as I continue in this treatment.

What I should expect over the coming months is a progressive weakening as the cumulative effects of multiple rounds take their toll. I&#8217;ll start losing my hair in a few weeks. That&#8217;s in the back of my mind but the immediate goal is to understand what the trajectory of a single round looks like. From there I should be able to better anticipate what to expect. The primary issue right now is that my energy is way low. Let&#8217;s see how this piece progresses.

With all the sleeping I&#8217;ve been having some vivid dreams. Last night my body was like a wind-up clock running out of energy &#8211; kind of an obvious extension of my afternoon walk. Typically dream time for me is non-linear, but this one was different in that the cadence of my gait started fairly normal towards the beginning. By the end of the dream I had to use my arms to pull on nearby railings and fixtures to proceed. I was moving in molasses. Each step took about 20 seconds. I was counting. My legs were failing, a progressive paralysis.

I got up at 2:30am in a cold sweat feeling like total shit. My back felt like it was used for batting practice. But I broke a smile when I rolled out of bed and was able to make it to the kitchen for a glass of water. I did it quickly!

I think my mind was trying to tell me something:

 _Never mind the limitations. Focus on what you have._<figure id="attachment_163" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
