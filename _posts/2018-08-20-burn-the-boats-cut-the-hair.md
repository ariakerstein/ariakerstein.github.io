I pulled out the clippers. I don&#8217;t need hair where I&#8217;m going. And why hold onto it anyway &#8211; it&#8217;s just going to fall out sooner or later. Last thing I need is clumps of hair coming out of my head. So I decided to shave it off in one decisive moment. This&#8217;ll happen on my terms.<!--more-->

There is no commitment without surrender. It&#8217;s interesting because committing to an action seems on the surface to be the opposite of surrender. Surrender implies defeat whereas commitment suggests aims toward some success/desired outcome. But the reason commitment is also surrender is because alternate paths and options are cut off. And paths are seldom linear things &#8211; we must surrender to the unknown obstacles that we&#8217;ll encounter while moving toward the goal. The only options left are to work the problem minus distractions of alternate paths &#8211; which helps focus on creative solutions. Only a singular focus on the mission remains. Surrender to the path.

A historical example I always loved is that on invading Mexico [Cortez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire) is said to have told his men to burn the ships so they could not retreat (I think it&#8217;s accurate but I&#8217;ll stand corrected if my history is off). They would conquer the land or die trying. This move constitutes a brilliant pre-emptive strike. But instead of attacking the enemy it&#8217;s an attack on one&#8217;s own psyche, on team morale, toward maintaining clarity on the mission. No surrender. No alternatives. Success or death.

Lest this get too abstract I think a concrete exercise might help illustrate.

**Here&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve done over the years, maybe it&#8217;ll work for you (it&#8217;s not for everyone):** If you live by some body of cold water, say the Pacific ocean as I do, commit to going in. New Englanders &#8211; this will work for you too, especially effective if it&#8217;s not summer:). And no wetsuits either. Go in and cover your head. Stay in for 2-5 minutes or longer. MANDATORY DISCLAIMER: check w/your doctor first if you have medical issues!

It&#8217;s scary to jump into 55 degree h20. Your body will say no. But if you truly commit then your mind will say YES. And you will be proud when you&#8217;re done.

What I love about this is the levels at which the exercise works. First off there are **real stakes involved** (physical pain, though transient and tolerable). There&#8217;s a **decision** to do this. There&#8217;s **fear/apprehension** and of course** surrender** when you shut the car door and are left in your undies/swimsuit staring at the freezing cold water. There&#8217;s **stages of entry**: feet, knees, waist, head &#8211; all **potential fail points** as each step gets progressively &#8220;harder&#8221;. Once you&#8217;re in there&#8217;s the shock of cold and the body&#8217;s **withdrawal reflex** to get out asap! Then there&#8217;s the battle of the body against the mind. How strong is your will? Here&#8217;s where you test your **mettle**. Are you tough enough to stay in and do as you said? Or **will you give in** to the desires of the body. Finally, there&#8217;s the payoff, the **satisfaction** of executing your plan. For this example the satisfaction works on 2 levels: a) the **mental satisfaction** of doing a hard thing, b) the **endorphin release**. Speaking personally this is among the most sure-fire methods for getting high naturally. I&#8217;m not sure if this is the case for everyone but I feel reborn every time I do this. There&#8217;s nothing like it.

Try it out. Let me know how it works for you.<figure id="attachment_231" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
