I&#8217;ve been back home since Saturday pm.Â I slept all Sunday and most of Monday. As of Tuesday I&#8217;ve been feeling mostly back to normal.<!--more-->

The G-CSF worked incredibly well to stimulate the growth of neutrophils. My counts shot up from a dangerously low <100 to a healthy 1000 within 48 hours, then to 3000 within 72 hours. Apparently my bone marrow is very healthy. So I&#8217;m no longer neutropenic. Apparently this severity of immunosuppression affects under 10% of folks going through my chemo protocol (not sure underlying causes). It&#8217;s also unclear to me why they didn&#8217;t check for this since post chemo infusion white blood counts reach their nadir around day 7-10. This would have been actionable information. I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s because 90% of patients don&#8217;t experience this though I&#8217;ve been asking around and haven&#8217;t gotten a good answer yet. Will be digging into this piece w/oncology team. I&#8217;ll likely need to supplement my chemo with these g-csf injections to ensure I stay out of the neutropenic red zone. I&#8217;ll pickup chemo next week.

Also my hair has started falling out. This really would have been more troubling had I not pre-empted by shaving my head. Literally every time I touch my scalp I get a clump/handful of hair (see below). I took a shower yesterday and the tub was literally filled with hair. I lost about 30% of my hair in the space of a 5 minute shower. It&#8217;s a reminder that despite feeling fairly ok I am sick and these drugs are doing their thing.

I&#8217;ve always associated the start of the school year with freshness, opportunity and potential. In a strange way I still feel that way despite the circumstances.<figure id="attachment_249" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
