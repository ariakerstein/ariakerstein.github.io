[Theme: finding one's place in the world]

The cursor pulses hot green against the black terminal. A few quick taps execute the script. I watch the simulation unfold on the screen. Then, a stocatto barrage of keystrokes: <i>Simulation number 39...no change from 38...The pX protein displays kinetics suggesting diffusion as the primary mechanic of nucleus traversal. In the presence of DNA breaks the molecular kinetics change and the molecule activates a cascade catalyzing repair complex formation.....</i>

I stop and lean back in the creaky lab chair. I interlace my fingers behind my skull, sigh deeply and consider the ceiling..... 

We travel by Buick leaving suburban safety behind. The car pulls into the reserved spot, <i>“For management only”</i>, it reads. My father and I step out and walk toward the building. I’m 12 years old and going to work.

It takes 40 seconds to walk from car seat to factory entrance. In that time my brain floods with feelings, ideas and a hell of a lot of confusion. I look up as I walk. The single-story white facade masks the hum of activity happening in the subterranean city-block - tip of an iceberg.  

I’m the only kid here. That’s the most obvious difference. I’m also not here because I need to support my family. To say I want to be here is a stretch, but it's my choice. This was the best solution available to the question, <i>“What will you do with your summer?”</i>. I was acting partially in response to my loathing of suburban comfort. And I didn’t fit in anywhere or have many friends, so I wasn't missing out on much. I resented - in a fuzzy way - what my peer groups were doing with their families (fancy camps, country clubs) and wanted none of it. This was my mild form of protest. No, I come from workers. I want to get my hands dirty. 

A strange gravity has orbited me around this place since I was a toddler. Time to go in and explore. 

My grandfather built this place - one of the largest metallizing and electroplating factories in America. Millions of pieces processed each week. Metallizing, Electroplating? We know these parts but they are seldom considered, think: coat hangers, lighting fixtures, reflectors, toy trophies, handles, thermos caps, cosmetic tubes, furniture knobs, bottle caps, computer logos. It's fitting this work on seldom considered parts should happen in a subterranean shop by anonymous souls. I count myself among them. 

On the walk over I get a bit dizzy as my identity ties itself in knots: (1) grandson of the revered ‘Nat’, holder of patents, president of the chemical society, war hero, iron-fisted leader of this place; (2) son of the lead engineer; (3) sheltered private school nerd coming to see how the other side lives (my personal race condition - in which I thought about what I thought they were thinking about me); (4) Scrawny Jewish kid?; (5) golden boy, quick to learn (6) loser, working for $10/hour instead of enjoying my summer and making friends (7) ...

We approach the men standing outside. Absent attendance to coffee, cigarettes, crass banter. They dress in tough materials: coveralls, jackets, beanie caps, shaggy beards, bed head. I have no idea the topics in discussion, might as well be a foreign language. It's 5:05am, a cool start to what I can already tell will be a balmy June day in Rhode Island.

We enter the heavy glass doors with a strong pull. I always go fast so I'm the puller, not sure why it matters to me but it does - more than it should. The lobby is beige, carpeted, quiet. Our entrance into the carpeted room identifies us as separate - the others enter via larger doors directly onto the shop floor. Upstairs is for executives and their secretaries. I see paper, computers, desks and offices.

I'm both drawn to and repulsed by the upstairs. There's a magic in it. On the shop floor I can understand the output of a piece of plastic from the machine it came from. But it's harder to connect the paper and desks with the creation of this place. It's too many steps removed. If the shop floor is about directness, the upstairs is about abstraction and indirection. 

As I head downstairs I'm conflicted. In my stomach I feel uneasy because I'm a part of the upstairs world with its higher pay with less muscular work. I Downstairs draws me because it's exotic. In contrast to the upstairs I'm sure that if I spend enough time here I can learn it all. 
The mystery is appealing despite - no, because - it's not clear I could ever understand it.  

I think that if I were more inclined toward taxonomies - as a butterfly collector - the fastest way to classify the people here would be by looking at the hands [callouses, palm lines/finger prints etched with dark stains: downstairs], [clean palms: upstairs]. I've never known my father's hands to be clean.

Hmm, respect. How do I know who has it, and how much? I secretly keep a notebook in my backpocket. I think a moment then write - <i>Respect has two parts: (1) earning it, then (2) using it</i>. The former is highly specific to the group code, like a mating dance. Activities that earn respect do not cross lines between groups. For example, in the downstairs world the acumen enabling a man to fix a complex bit of machinery would earn respect. That same acumen, applied by a secretary to the printer upstairs, would earn her little - it's her job after all. 
I make up some rules to capture the idea and continue scribbling: <i>a) it should be obvious to an outside observer by watching the group dynamics, b) you can get things from your own group with it</i>.

One time I saw my father dealing with a hard problem on a machine that stumped him and another engineer. we walked upstairs together. He had a quick chat behind a wall with someone in whispers - the upstairs is always quiet, even when things break. I hang nervously in a corner, drinking alone from a slippery conical paper cup I drew from the stack on the water cooler. Five minutes later he shoots me a glint and we head back to work downstairs. The following day I notice a swarm of men at the site fixing the intractable problem. He got the resources needed; respect in action. 

Hmm, I think, earn respect below then transfers it upstairs. I add to my list:<i>c) you can get things from other groups with it.</i>

A dark wooden door leads to the narrow stairwell downstairs. It's way too narrow - more what you'd expect visiting a friend’s house. The stairs are covered in circular lilly pads extruded from the purple rubber (for grip on rainy days, I wonder)? The doorway terminates in 5 or so dangling clear heavy plastic panels like in a large grocery freezer section meant to trap the cold air. I see it as an airlock separating my social contract from a metallic jungle. 

I take a large step through the portal and bounce on a steel sheet. The heavy metal squares that make up the floor here, about 4 feet to a side and bowed with tension (imagine holding the edges of an index card between thumb and forefinger and you'll get the idea). Each panel is sealed to its neighbor with crude welded blobs, like scartissue. I peer a moment at the gaps left by imperfection and wonder a moment what's below. With each step I bounce, playing with new powers. It's not quite Armstong on the moon, but it's close. The extra energy transfers through my hard-soled boots, propelling me along my y-axis. Industrial bouncing. Absently I file this one away for a good example use of the term "oxymoron". 

The vapor solvents overwhelm me. Hot paint fumes mixed with other harsh industrial chemicals, degreasers and masculine morning routines - aftershave, hair gel. And the noise. Loud beeps break the background hum of heavy machines. Men shout orders to each other over the background noise. Tinny, high-pitched intercom vibrations rise above all else and bounce off the metallic surfaces. <i>“Manny 62346, Manny 62346”. Click! </i>

Phones are strategically placed around the factory, physical addresses describing this maze. The message is a catenation of location + person. If someone calls your name you would walk over to that phone’s location as someone needs help there. The most frequently called name is ‘Moti’, my father. A solid way to quantify respect is in the frequency of names called over the intercom. I scribble hash marks for each name/call pairing on a new sheet. That's a source of pride. He knows every bit of machinery. In fact, he's built or conceived most of them. 

If my personal feeling structure were to form a pyramid then that pride for the work my family did would be at the apex. In the middle is awkwardness around my identity in this context. How do I fit in here? These men were struggling for survival and I was here out of, what, curiosity? Then, at the base, supporting the whole structure is awe. Awe fills me and fuels my efforts here. It keeps me waking up at 5:05 every day in the summer jumping out of bed. At least 3 times per hour I consider how could a person conceive, let alone build something so strange, complicated - and yes – strangely wonderful? I love bouncing when I walk!
 
The first order of business today is for my father to confer with the foreman to decide where I’ll be working for the next 6 hours. I have no say but that doesn't matter. My small body fills with a giddy excitement as I wait - a new day, a new world to explore.  

Each room in this factory is a different in the same way as sampling a rod of cold-rolled steel under high powered magnification would present different atomic structures. It would not be obvious that all belonged to the same entity: would the room have posters on the wall with bakini-clad females behind a tool chest (they allow this?)? Would there be a radio playing modern rock, oldies? Would there be banter between the guys, or silence? Would there be a window?

There's one quiet place here, it's on the third floor. The assembly tables where (almost without exception) the women would work. The work was delicate, detail-oriented and did not require strength. They would wrap small plastic pieces in copper wire attached to heavy square racks. Once all slots filled, the women would signal completion to a (without exception) large man and hand the racks over. He would place it onto industrial-grade dolly and when that filled he would roll it across the metallic floors (aha! The metal flooring helps these cages roll!) to take the pieces to ovens for baking.

You might think these are all factory workers, all the same kind of person. That would be inaccurate. Distinctive subcultures transcend ethnic group (blacks, whites, Indians, and Cape Verdians). Cultures seem to be more forged by discipline or work area than by cultural affiliation.

For example, a machining room would value precision and process. A paint assembly line room would value efficiency of motion to reduce latency and optimize throughput. Then there are the immersion baths that sat on large areas of palates arranged in circular patterns. Large muscular black men dominate this area. They lift large racks of metal and dunk them, assisted by some crane-like machines, into baths filled with colored solutions. There it seems raw strength was most important. One day I walked through this area with my father and nearly pass out smelling the solvents. Spending a day with such toxic stuff cannot be good for the body. 

I look down at the palettes as I walk and notice solvent drips sinking into the unfinished wood. I think about how my grandfather saw what others missed in order to build this place. 

My favorite story is the time he went to a competitor's foreclosure. This is a tough business and few companies survive. They were liquidating the machines and equipment. He passed over all the heavy stuff, wanting only the wooden throwaway palettes. They were not selling them but if he wanted to haul them off well go right ahead. One less thing to clear out they figured. Knowing more about their business then they did, apparently, he distilled out the gold drippings. He made a mini fortune from that insight. Magic.

Today I'll be welding. We walk down a familiar corridor but turn a corner toward an alley I hadn’t seen before. Staccato blue electricity rips the air, illuminating the otherwise dark room. I cover my ears as we approach. We enter the shop and I notice a man covering his face with a black mask. I look down to avoid, what, blindness? 
The lightning stops. I unseal my palms from my ears. Still silent. Safe. I look up. The man slides the mask above his head and inspects his work by eye. A pause. he looks over, then.

“Moti. How are you. Who is this?” he asks in a loud voice, looking at me. Everyone shouts down here, independent of context.
“This is my son. He’ll be helping you today. Please put him to work. If he misbehaves you know where to find me.” A laugh. 
“Sure thing. Ok kid, you got a name?”. He extends a giant hand and we shake.
“Hi, Ari”, I managed.
“Let’s have some fun.” He said. My name is “Big Bird”. I didn’t ask him why they called him that. But this frames my focus as he does resemble an ostrich with his curly blond hair and large glasses. I associated him with Sesame Street. 

“So what do you like to do kid?”, he asked. I looked up.
“Not sure. I kind of like working with my hands.” I said.
“Nah”, he cut in, “you got better things coming, kid. You don’t want to be like me, or these guys. Look at us”. I cringed inside, pegged as 'other'. But he had a point. Damage control - I wasn't ready to admit that I wanted to do science - that would just confirm how different I was. No way, too high-falutent. I’d never bridge the gap. Engineering seemed like a good middle-ground for connection.
“I mean that I like to build things” I said.
“That’s good, kid” he said.
 
A loud knock. The cursor still blinks on the terminal. I sit back up. 
"Come in", I shout, not bothering to turn around. It's Jean, my assistant. "Your 2:00 is here", she says. "Please reschedule it", I say. 

I grab my phone, slip on the running shoes that live under my desk. And I jog...down the hall...into the world... no route, no plan. Satellite imagery would reveal a bumping pixel diffusing through city blocks. For a time I forget. No me, no others, no work, no caring. I get lost in a pleasant neutrality. Movement is my master. I get tired and stop, stretching a moment. I notice my palms, sweaty but clean. Then I remember and sprint back to the lab.
