[Theme: finding one's place in the world]

The cursor pulses hot green against the black terminal. A few quick keyboard taps execute the script. I watch the simulation unfold on the screen. Then, a stocatto barrage of keystrokes: <i>reaction-diffusion simulation number 39...no change from number 38...the molecule diffuses within the nuclear space. The p53 molecule displays kinetics suggesting diffusion as the primary mechanic of nucleus traversal. When in proximity (within x-y micometers) to the repair complex the p53 kinetics shift. Specifically our kinetic curves strongly support reaction dynamics that suggest interaction with other proteins (e.g., rad complex etc.) involved in the double-strand repair complex formation. This results in an annealing process that ultimately results in high fidelity DNA repair.....</i>

I stop and lean back in the creaky lab chair. I interlace my fingers behind my skull, sigh deeply and consider the ceiling..... 

We travel by Buick leaving suburban safety behind. The car pulled into the reserved spot, “For management only”, it read. My father and I step out and walk toward the building. I’m 12 years old and going to work.

It takes 40 seconds to walk from car seat to factory entrance. In that time my brain floods with feelings, ideas and a hell of a lot of confusion. I look up as I walk. The single-story white facade masks the hum of activity happening in the subterranean city-block - tip of an iceberg.  

I’m the only kid here. That’s the most obvious difference. I’m also not here because I need to support my family. To say I want to be here is a stretch, but it's my choice. This was the best solution available to the question, “What will you do with your summer?”. I was acting partially in response to my loathing of suburban comfort. And I didn’t fit in anywhere obvious, so I wasn't missing out on anything obvious either. I resented - in a fuzzy way - what my peer groups were doing with their families (fancy camps, country clubs) and wanted none of it. This was my mild form of protest. No, I come from workers. I want to get my hands dirty. 

A strange gravity had orbited me around this place for a long time. Now it's time to go in and explore. This is the what my grandfather built, one of the largest metallizing and electroplating factories in America. Millions of pieces processed each week. Metallizing, Electroplating? Take a moment and scan your surroundings. If you're indoors I'll bet you’re within arms reach of such a piece, think: coat hangers, lighting fixtures, reflectors, toy trophies, handles, thermos caps, cosmetic tubes, furniture knobs, bottle caps, computer logos. Metallizing is the process of coating the raw parts with a finish that makes them look good and withstand abuse. It requires a mix of chemistry interacting with mechanical handling of parts done at industrial scale. 

On the walk over my identity tied itself into knots: (1) grandson of the revered ‘Nat’, holder of patents, president of the chemical society and iron-fisted leader of this place; (2) son of the lead engineer; (3) sheltered private school nerd coming to see how the other side lives (my personal race condition - in which I thought about what I thought they were thinking about me); (4) Scrawny Jewish kid?; (5) golden boy, quick to learn (6) loser, working for $10/hour instead of enjhoying my summer and making friends (7) ...

We pass the men standing outside. They focus on coffee, cigarettes, banter. They dress in tough materials: coveralls, jackets, beanie caps, shaggy beards, bed head. I had no idea what they were talking about. It's 5:05am, a cool start to what I can already tell will be a balmy June day in Rhode Island.

We enter the heavy glass doors with a strong pull. I always go fast so I'm the one pulling, not sure why it matters to me but it does - more than it should. The lobby is beige, carpeted, quiet.

This is a place of unstated divisions. There's a major fault line separating above from below. I'll explain it here but it's so fundamental to the place that it's like middle-school cliques. Upstairs is for executives and their secretaries. My family - except for my father. It's the place for paper, computers and invisible magic - you need to apply your mind to understand it. Somehow the activites up here - paper shuffling, calls and meetings keep this place going. Downstairs is for laborers, workers: loud, dark, dirty. You can see and understand the activities with your eyes the way you might understand an engine - not easy, but doable with the right effort. I'm both drawn to and repulsed by the upstairs. It strikes me as unequal - higher pay with less elemental struggle, less muscular output. I also know enough about my biases to cut past this idea that things that look like struggle are worth the most. The mystery is appealing despite - no, because - it's not clear I could ever understand it. Downstairs draws me because it's so different than anything I've ever seen. It's like exploring the rainforest. But I'm sure that if I spent enough time here I could learn all of it. 

If one inclined toward identifications - like a butterfly collector - the fastest way to classify the species here would be through examining the hands: [callouses, palm lines/finger prints etched with dark stains: downstairs], [clean palms: upstairs].

Each area has a definitive code. The language, dress and social norms are different. And the output is not only wages, but more acutely I see it's about group respect. 
Respect has two parts: (1) earning it, then (2) using it. The former is highly specific to the group code - like a mating dance. Activities that earn respect do not cross lines. For example, in the downstairs world the acumen enabling a man to fix a complex bit of machinery would earn respect. That same acumen, applied by a secretary to a printer upstairs, would earn her little - it's just her job after all. 

But the currency of respect does. That's what my father does. He earns respect below, then transfers it upstairs. Steeping respect in fiscal terms makes sense, though it requires a different accounting practice. So how can I know who has it? 
The rules I considered: a) it should be obvious to an outside observer by watching the group dynamics, b) you can get things from your own group with it c) you can get things from other groups with it.

One time I saw my father dealing with a hard problem on a machine that stumped them. He walked upstairs, me behind him, he had a quick chat behind a wall with someone in whispers - the upstairs was always quiet, even when things broke - and went back to work. The next day there was a swarm of men at the site fixing the intractable problem. That was respect in action. 

A dark wooden door leads to the narrow stairwell downstairs, the kind you might expect when visiting a friend’s house. The stairs are covered in what look like circular lilly pads extruded from the purple rubber (for grip on rainy days, I wonder)? The doorway leads to 5 or 6 dangling clear heavy plastic panels like you might find at a grocery freezer section to trap the cold air; an airlock describing the threshold to a world of metal. 

I take a large step through the panels and leave the familiar. I bounce atop a steel sheet. The heavy metal squares that make up the floor here bowed with tension, each one sealed to its neighbor with crude tack-welds. With each step I bounce, playing with my powers - not quite the moon since gravity is the same - but fun, as energy transfers from the springy slabs through my hard-soled boots and through my body. Industrial bouncing. I'd file this one away for a good example use of the term "oxymoron". 

The vapor solvents overwhelm me for the first few minutes. Hot paint fumes mixed with other harsh industrial chemicals, degreasers and masculine morning routines - aftershave.
The noise disorients me for a moment, until I adjust. Loud beeps break the persistent hum of heavy machines. Humans shout mundane orders to each other over the background noise. Tinny, high-pitched intercom vibrations cut through everything and bounce off the metallic surfaces. <i>“Manny 62346, Manny 62346”. Click! </i>

Phones were strategically placed around the factory, physical addresses describing the maze. The message was a catenation of location + person. If someone called your name you would walk over to that phone’s location. Someone needed help there. The most frequently called name was ‘Moti’, my father. That was a source of pride. He knew every bit of machinery. In fact, he had built or conceived most of them. I figured if I wanted to quantify respect it would be in the frequency of names called over the intercom. 

But feelings of awkwardness filled my psyche. How do I fit in here, if at all? These men were struggling for survival and I was here out of, what, curiosity? 
But it's awe that dominates and keeps me here. How could a person conceive, let alone build something so strange, complicated - and yes – wonderful? Am I the only one that finds the bouncing to be liberating? 

Questions to consider as I walked:
-   Environment: where did so much steel come from? How did it get here?
-   Machines: There were so many. What did they all do? How did they work?
-   Operations: there was a potent mix of seeming chaos, but there was obvious logic around how all this was coordinated. But I just couldn’t grasp what it was.
-   Jobs: what jobs were required? What exactly did everyone do? Which mattered the most? Who got the most respect?  
-   People: who were these people I was working alongside? Why were they here? Did they enjoy this work?
-   Customers: who was buying this stuff anyway? How did they find the factory?
-   Numbers: so many pieces of plastic everywhere! Each piece needed to be handled, molecules of paint affixed to them with minimal waste. How are they all kept orderly? 
 
The first order of business as we crossed that threshold was for my father to confer with the foreman, and decide where I’d be working for the next 6 hours. My small body filled with a giddy excitement as I waited - a new day, a new area, new world to explore. I had no say but it didn’t matter. 

Each room in this factory was a different in the same way as perhaps looking at a rod of 1015 cold-rolled steel under high powered magnification would present different atomic structures. You wouldn't guess it was all part of a unified entity. Each had a different vibe, set of characters and values. Would the room have a poster of scantily clad female behind a tool chest (they allow this?)? Would there be a radio playing modern rock, oldies? Would there be banter between the guys, or silence? Would there be a window?

There was only one quiet place here, on the third floor. The assembly tables where (almost without exception) the women would work. The work was delicate, detail-oriented and did not require strength. They would wrap small plastic pieces in copper wire attached to heavy square racks. Once all slots filled, the women would signal completion to a (without exception) large man and hand the racks over. He would place it onto industrial-grade dolly and when that filled he would roll it across the metallic floors (aha! The metal flooring helps these cages roll!) to take the pieces to ovens for baking.

You might think these are all factory workers, all the same kind of person. That would be inaccurate. There were distinctive subcultures that transcended ethnic group (blacks, whites, Indians, and Cape Verdians). What I observed was the cultures seemed to be more forged by discipline or work area than by cultural affiliation.

For example, a machining room would value precision and process. A paint assembly line room would value efficiency of motion to reduce latency and optimize throughput. Then there were the immersion baths that sat on large areas of palates arranged in circular patterns. Large muscular black men dominated this area. They would lift large racks of metal and dunk them, assisted by some crane-like machines, into baths filled with colored solutions. There it seemed raw strength was most important. I recall walking through these areas with my father and nearly passed out smelling the solvents. I couldn’t imagine what spending a day so close to such toxic stuff could do to a person.

I looked down at the palettes as I walked. I noticed solvent drips sink into the unfinished wood. One of the stories about my grandfather was that he once went to a competitors foreclosure. This is a tough business and few companies survive. They were auctioning the machines and equipment. He passed over all the heavy stuff, he only wanted the palettes. Suit yourself, they handed it over, one less thing to clear out they figured. He made a mini fortune distilling out the gold drippings trapped in the wood. Lesson: brains beat brawn. 

Today, welding. We walk down a familiar corridor but turn a corner toward an alley I hadn’t seen before. Staccato blue electricity rips the air, illuminating the otherwise dark room. I cover my ears as we approach. We enter the shop. I notice a man covering his face with a black mask. I look down to avoid, what, blindness? 
The lightning stops. I unseal my palms from my ears. Good, still silent. I look up. The man slides the mask above his head and inspects his work by eye. A pause. he looks over, then.

“Moti. How are you. Who is this?” he asks in a loud voice, looking at me. Everyone shouts down here, independent of context.
“This is my son. He’ll be helping you today. Please put him to work. If he misbehaves you know where to find me.” A laugh. 
“Sure thing. Ok kid, you got a name?”. He extends a giant hand and we shake.
“Hi, Ari”, I managed.
“Let’s have some fun.” He said. My name is “Big Bird”. I didn’t ask him why they called him that. But this frames my focus as he does resemble an ostrich with his curly blond hair and large glasses. I associated him with Sesame Street. 

We move....

“So what do you like to do kid?”, he asked. I looked up.
“Not sure. I kind of like working with my hands.” I said.
“Nah”, he cut in, “you got better things coming, kid. You don’t want to be like me, or these guys. Look at us”. He had a point. But I fixated on fitting in and felt like admitting that I wanted to do science would out me as different. Too high-falutent. I’d never be able to bridge the gap. Engineering seemed like a good middle-ground for connection.
“I mean that I like to build things” I said.
“That’s good, kid” he said.
 
A knock. The cursor blinks on the terminal. I sit back up. 
"Come in", I shout, not bothering to turn around. It's Jean, my assistant.
