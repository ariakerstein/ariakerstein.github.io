<h1>Problem </h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parents have accumulated many lego sets over years. But the instructions are missing or kids tire of building a set (typically only once). Often times pieces go missing. What to do with all these legos? There are great additional lego sets that can be built with those items if only the right instructions were handy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>What is it?&nbsp;</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A platform to enable parents to build more sets. The key parts include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>identify existing legos</li><li>Map to instruction sets relevant to those items</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Market size/Opportunity</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 125+ households in the US, 40% of these have children under 18 years of age. Assuming half of those are lego enthusiasts (play regularly) that's roughly 25M households in the US. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Goals - measuring success:</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The success of this app would come ultimately through how heavily this gets used. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Acquisition -- new signups; </li><li>Usage -- Daily uploads; </li><li>Retention -- repeat usage; </li><li>Monetization -- affiliate links to buy the missing parts (integrate or redirect to lego.com)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Whoâ€™s it for (who desperately needs it)?</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parents  (or older kids)</strong>- Houses typically have many lego sets. Typically these get aggregated into a large bin once the instructions have been built. This is a shame as many more sets could be built but never do. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1>Solution</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Users will upload their legos to the app. This can happen in 2 ways. The simple way is to select sets they have from a visual list. Once entered the app will return instructions for other lego sets that could be built.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more interesting way of building this is leveraging AI libraries. In this flow the user will lay out their legos on the floor. They would then snap pictures from multiple angles to ensure complete identification. Those legos would then map to the pieces required in any set. The list of relevant instructions would be returned. These could either be printed, ordered or viewed online.</p>

<h1>Why build it? Why now?</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>With shelter in place, parents are stuck at home with kids. Finding non-media oriented and creative uses of time is important. Also, spending less money on (expensive toys) in these times with rampant unemployment is massively valuable to families. </li></ul>
