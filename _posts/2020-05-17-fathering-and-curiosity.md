Fatherhood is not easy. One of the challenges is the role switch. I recall telling my grandmother (and she reminded me often during her long life) at age 5 that "I'm a player, not a worker". Fast forward several decades and I was doing science. The big draw of science is that it's a place where (at best) a person can hold onto their childish spark. We are all born scientists. But holding onto that endowment, that curiosity takes concerted effort (for most of us). I still believe it's a haven for the young at heart. But the other place this can happen is technology, or any sort of building, making. What I love is the potent mix of creative pursuit married to technical acumen: curiosity + craftsmanship. That's what it's about, undergirded by a foundation of love.
