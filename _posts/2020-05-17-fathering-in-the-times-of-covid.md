Fatherhood is not easy. One of the challenges is the role switch. I recall telling my grandmother (and she reminded me often during her long life) at age 5 that "I'm a player, not a worker". Fast forward several decades and I was doing science. The big draw of science is that it's a place where (at best) a person can hold onto their childish spark. We are born scientists and indeed I still believe it's a haven for the young at heart. But the other place this can happen is technology, or any sort of building. It's a creative pursuit married to technical acumen about how exactly to build the thing well. So the elements are curiosity + craftsmanship. It helps to have the resources to do this well.
