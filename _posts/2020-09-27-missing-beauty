<p>Armstrong bobbed on the moon. And the tiny shoulders started shaking in my cupped hand, a seismograph needle scratching an earthquake. Then a bomb! </p>



<p>I paused the movie to check on him.  </p>



<p>The show director had interspersed some iconic cuts of the moon landing to make a point about something. We take this stuff for granted. Just images after all. But these kids haven&#8217;t yet seen the miracles of history. They don&#8217;t know. Lev turned to me, innocently offering, &#8220;daddy, I didn&#8217;t know it was like that&#8221;. It broke me. Indeed, these events, while clearly science and engineering, are also magical wonders. Why should there be a moon at all? Or anything, for that matter?</p>


<p>I love ratios. They are such elegant things, demonstrating an understanding about otherwise disparate variables. The ratio for today is the beauty I never knew: observed/available. It saddens me greatly. Retrospecting about the years and the roads not taken, the thoughts not thunk.  I think about the beauty that will be tomorrow. Most of it I&#8217;ll miss for several categories of reason including, not limited to a) living in my head too much, b) being busy at work, c) being preoccupied about something or other (see &#8216;a&#8217;), and d) simply missing it due to the finiteness of my form. I can only cover so much ground. But there&#8217;s no doubt that across the world very beautiful things will occur, should I be attuned to them. How might I increase my levels of attunement? </p>
