The creation of a masterpiece is about reduction. When famously asked how to scuplt an elephant, the great Michelangelo replied something to the effect of, "by removing any parts that are not elephant". I find it helpful to think about what parts of my mindset are not helpful. In moving toward a vision of existence that I would prefer it's about removing the stuff that's not moving me forward. It's mostly dust on the lens of my seeing. Then consider what removing those parts might look like. </p>
