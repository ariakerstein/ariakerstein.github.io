I did a tai chi class the other day. What struck me about this is a feeling of rootedness. You aren&#8217;t moving much, certainly not compared to running a marathon. That said there&#8217;s something interesting about mastering one&#8217;s own &#8216;frame&#8217; as it&#8217;s called, basically what&#8217;s in arms reach. In Tolstoy&#8217;s _[how much land does a man need](http://www.online-literature.com/tolstoy/2738/)_ the protagonist seeks all this land/fortune, but in the end the punch line is:<!--more-->

> His servant picked up the spade and dug a grave long enough for Pahom to lie in, and buried him in it. Six feet from his head to his heels was all he needed.

So there&#8217;s something great about going the opposite direction to this idea of more and moving toward the bare minimum, taking the essential amount of land we need in a given moment and bringing a total awareness to it. I find myself doing tai chi as I walk around, helping me be more mindful in the day-to-day.
