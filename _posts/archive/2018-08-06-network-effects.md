I splurged on my wedding. My rationale was that there are only two times you get close to having your whole network in one place, your wedding and your funeral. I&#8217;ll now amend that to include a third event &#8211; getting diagnosed with cancer.

<!--more-->For all that&#8217;s horrible about this there are benefits to having cancer if you know where to look&#8230;

First, the amount of support I&#8217;ve received in the past few weeks, not only from friends and family, but friends of friends is inspiring. I am deeply grasping the power of this force &#8211; it has a life of it&#8217;s own and inspires me.

Second, openness to pain and sadness allow us to connect in a deeper way with our fellow humans. Not only do I resolve to win this battle with strength & grace, but in victory to re-orient toward giving & contribution (less me, more we!).  I&#8217;m touched by Clayton Christensen&#8217;s note in [How will you measure your life](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/18907551-how-will-you-measure-your-life), &#8220;_I’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the individual people whose lives I’ve touched.&#8221;_
